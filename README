There seems to be a problem with DateTime being used by Template Toolkit.

I'm not sure if the bug is in Template or in DateTime, but so far I've been
able to narrow it down to the fact that the system that breaks is a 64-bit
platform.

System perl is used, but both CPAN modules are installed to a non-root user
using local::lib.

The problem is that when I try to access the DateTime variable in the
template, the process exits without any error message. It doesn't die in a
trappable way, it just exits.
